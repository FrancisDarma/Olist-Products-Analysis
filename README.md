## Business Strategy Recommendations

**1. Promotion Strategy:** Based on the above data, the business can focus on promoting products in the Health and Beauty category, especially in cities with a large number of customers such as Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Offer discounts and special prices for customers who frequently purchase beauty products and introduce a membership program with shopping reward points for future health and beauty purchases.

**2.  Increase Stock in July and August:** Since the sales trend peaks in the middle of the year, it's essential to increase stock levels in those months to meet the peak demand.

**3.  Collaboration with Banks:** Collaborate with banks to offer promotions and discounts for purchases made through credit cards, especially for high-revenue categories like Watches and Gifts and Health and Beauty. Implement these promotions when sales are not at their peak (outside of August and May).

**4.  Channel Acquisition Strategy:** Consider acquiring downstream channels such as distributors, especially for products with the highest sales, including bed, bath, table, watches, gifts, health, beauty, and sports, leisure. This strategy aims to minimize costs and create superior offers in terms of price and value to customers.

**5.  Create Own Products:** Building on point 4, if demand is significant, the company can consider meeting demand by manufacturing its products for each category at a more affordable price. This is done to ensure that the demand for high-revenue categories is met.

**6.  Implement Recommendation Systems:** After identifying which products each customer buys the most, consider implementing a recommendation system on the web platform. This system is intended to offer personalized recommendations for products that different customers may be interested in, increasing the likelihood of them making a purchase.
