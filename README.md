# Olist-Products-Analysis

In this dataset, we will conduct an analysis of product purchases using both exploratory data analysis and the RFM approach to find out:

1. Which product categories have the Highest Sales and Revenue?
2. Which product categories exhibit the Best RFM Scores?
3. What are the Trends and Sales Cycles for each product category?
4. Which products show significant growth compared to previous years?

From the information above, we will analyze business strategies that the company can implement to address customer habits revealed in this dataset.
